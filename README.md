# Poker Game

This is a single player poker game where a user makes a bet and wins/loses credits based on their hand. 
First, the player inputs the bet amount into a text box that can only take valid numbers.
Next the player draws cards and pays their bet. With another click, the hand is analyzed.
At this point the player can play again if they have a remaining balance.


# Motivation

This project was created using CSS, HTML, and Javascript. Originally, the backend was done as an assignment in an Introduction to Java class.
This project had increased my interest in Computer Science and I had always wanted to see what it was like to implement the front end.
So, this became my first experience in front end work and using languages involved in this project.
